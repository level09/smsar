Requirements:
-------------
 - Drupal 6.x
 - taxonomy.module
 - upload.module (if using the ad_image module)

-------------
Installation:
-------------
1) Extract the ad tarball.  Move the resulting 'ad/' subdirectory within the
   correct 'sites/*/modules/' directory.  Be sure the web server has read
   permissions to this directory and the files within it.

   NOTE:  For optimal performance you should set the DRUPAL_ROOT variable at
   the top of the adserve.inc file.  Otherwise, the ad module will automatically
   determine your top level Drupal directory each time it serves an
   advertisement.

2) Log in to your website and enable the ad.module.
    (Goto :: administer >> modules :: then put a check next to 'ad')

3) If you wish to display image (banner) ads, enable the ad_image.module.  If
   it's not already enabled, you will also need to enable the upload.module.
    (Goto :: administer >> modules :: then put a check next to 'ad_image' and
     'upload'.)

   You can set per-group limitations for image ads at administer >> modules >>
   groups >> image ads.

4) If you wish to display text ads, enable the ad_text.module.
    (Goto :: administer >> modules :: then put a check next to 'ad_text')

   You can set global limitations for text ads at administer >> modules >>
   settings >> text ads.

5) If you wish to embed ads into your site content, enable the ad_embed.module.
    (Goto :: administer >> modules :: then put a check next to 'ad_embed')

   You can configure embedded ads at administer >> modules >> settings >>
   embedded ads.  There is also online help available if you enable the Drupal
   help module and go to administer >> help >> ad_embed.

6) If you wish to provide online graphical reports along with your ads, enable
   the ad_report module.
    (Goto :: administer >> modules :: then put a check next to 'ad_report')

7) If you wish to filter out duplicate clicks and other invalid clicks (as
   detailed in the README), enable the click_filter module.
    (Goto :: administer >> modules :: then put a check next to 'click_filter')

8) Assign the 'show advertisements' permission to all roles that you wish to
   see advertisements.
    (Goto :: administer >> user management >> access control :: then put a
     check next to 'show advertisements' for all roles that should see ads)

9) You can display ads in blocks by going to administer >> blocks and enabling
   the per-ad-group blocks that are automatically generated.

10) Optionally configure an input filter for your advertisements that allow
    the html tags to display correctly.
     (Goto :: administer >> site configuration >> input filters)
    If you need to associate a specific input filter with the advertisement
    content type, you may want to review the following projects:
      http://drupal.org/project/better_formats
      http://drupal.org/project/filterbynodetype

11) Optionally enable the date api and date popup modules, part of the date
    project:
      http://drupal.org/project/date
    Once enabled, you will be able to set the autoenable and autoexpire times
    using a popup calendar.

12) Optionally, if you're using the ad_image module and you'd like to keep your
    image uploads more organized, you may want to use one of the following modules
      http://drupal.org/project/filefield_paths
      http://drupal.org/project/uploadpath
